# Rust on Tidal

Trying to learn how embedded programming works by hacking on the EMF tidal6 badge.

So far, only blinking the LCD backlight works :D 

Most of this work is from trying to figure out how to port micropython firmware to rust-y firmware.

You'll need a [tilda6 badge](https://github.com/emfcamp/TiDAL-Hardware) to test this and you might brick it.
